```lrc
[00:27.38] With your loving there ain't nothing
[00:29.96] That I can't adore
[00:31.89] The way I'm running with you honey
[00:34.07] Means we can break every law
[00:36.45] I find it funny that you're the only
[00:38.79] One I never looked for
[00:41.04] There is something in your loving
[00:43.52] That tears down my walls
[00:55.52] 
[00:45.72] I weren't ready then (ready then), I'm ready now (ready now)
[00:48.68] I'm heading straight for you
[00:50.57] You will only be (only be), eternally (eternally)
[00:52.84] The one that I belong to
[01:04.84] 
[00:55.36] The sweetest devotion
[00:59.95] Hit me like an explosion
[01:04.54] All of my life, I've been frozen
[01:09.00] The sweetest devotion I know
[01:23.00] 
[01:36.56] I'll forever be whatever
[01:39.01] You want me to be
[01:41.27] I'd go under and all over
[01:43.73] For your clarity
[01:45.88] When you wonder if I'm gonna
[01:48.41] Lose my way home
[01:50.44] Just remember that come whatever
[01:52.42] I'll be yours all along
[02:03.92] 
[01:55.02] I weren't ready then (ready then), I'm ready now (ready now)
[01:57.66] I'm heading straight for you
[01:59.76] You will only be (only be), eternally (eternally)
[02:01.95] The one that I belong to
[02:13.95] 
[02:04.31] The sweetest devotion
[02:09.17] Hit me like an explosion
[02:13.82] All of my life, I've been frozen
[02:18.19] The sweetest devotion I know
[02:32.19] 
[02:36.83] I've been looking for you, baby
[02:38.92] In every face that I've ever known
[02:45.57] And there is something about the way you love me
[02:49.09] That finally feels like home
[02:54.80] You're my light, you're my darkness
[02:59.51] You're the right kind of madness
[03:04.22] You're my hope, you're my despair
[03:08.52] You're my scope of everything, everywhere
[03:29.02] 
[03:13.70] The sweetest devotion
[03:18.59] Hit me like an explosion
[03:23.06] All of my life, I've been frozen
[03:27.26] The sweetest devotion I know
[03:41.26] 
[03:41.45] Sweetest, it's the sweetest
[03:45.91] Sweetest, it's the sweetest
[03:50.67] Sweetest, it's the sweetest
[03:55.21] Sweetest, it's the sweetest
[03:59.02] Devotion
